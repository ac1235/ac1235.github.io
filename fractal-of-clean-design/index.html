        Python - A Fractal of Clean Design
      </h1>

      <p>
        Some Python programmers like to think of their language as flawless. I
        personally know some Python programmers claiming that Python is superior
        to other languages in its clean design and unmatched elegance.
      </p>

      <p>
        This however isn’t true. Python has at least as many deep and
        fundamental flaws as most other languages, despite parts of its
        community claiming something different.
      </p>

      <p>
        Scoping in Python is as broken as you’d expect a half-baked
        implementation of lexical scoping atop of a half-baked implementation of
        dynamic scoping to be.
      </p>

      <p>Take a look at this Scheme code.</p>

      <div class="language-scheme highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre
            class="highlight"
          ><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">define</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">modifier</span> <span class="nv">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">set!</span> <span class="nv">x</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">f</span> <span class="nv">x</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="nv">x</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>The equivalent in Python would be the following.</p>

      <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre
            class="highlight"
          ><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">modifier</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="n">ref</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">'contents'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">closure</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">ref</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">'contents'</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ref</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">'contents'</span><span class="p">])</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">ref</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">'contents'</span><span class="p">]</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">closure</span>
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Non-global variables from a parent scope in Python are accessible as
        read-only. (Except when they aren’t, but more on that later) This means,
        that only the values and not the variables themselves can be mutated,
        which means more needless boilerplate (don’t worry, we’ll talk about
        nonlocal soon).
      </p>

      <p>
        “But what about using classes?” I hear you say. Can’t we fake closures
        using them? As it turns out, no we can’t.
      </p>

      <p>Many Python programmers would write the above “function” like this:</p>

      <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre
            class="highlight"
          ><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">modifier</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__call__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        For those of you like me, who are blind to it when they see it: This is
        so called elegance.
      </p>

      <p>
        You may wonder where the problem with our elegant solution is. Like all
        other Python programmers, let’s just assume it does exactly the same and
        continue our journey through the surprisingly wonderful world of Python
        programming and briefly take a look at classes.
      </p>

      <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre
            class="highlight"
          ><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">A</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span>

<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">A</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">a</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">10</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>This is cool, isn’t it? Let’s go ahead and add a method.</p>

      <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre
            class="highlight"
          ><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">A</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

      </div>

      <p>
        Nice! As it turns out, functions defined inside of a class simply become
        methods, where the first argument becomes the object itself. Knowing
        that, let’s make a Counter class using our modifier function/class.
      </p>

      <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre
            class="highlight"
          ><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Counter</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="n">update</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">modifier</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__call__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">counter</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span>

<span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Counter</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">counter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">update</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="n">counter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">update</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="n">counter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">update</span><span class="p">())</span>
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        If modifier is defined as our true modifier function, this code works as
        you’d expect it to and prints “1 2 3.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Using our modifier class however it doesn’t. (See, I told you it won’t
        work)
      </p>

      <p>
        This is the kind of consistency you can expect from a well designed
        language like Python, and remember, that we just defined a “Counter”
        class so far as things already start to go downhill regarding clean
        language design.
      </p>

      <p>
        The reason why this works with our true function is because Python
        interprets the assignment of a function inside a class as a method
        definition and does its first-arg magic. Since our class only creates an
        object, that looks like a function (since it is a callable) Python
        interprets it as a slot definition and tells us, that it is missing the
        first argument (that we expected to be the object itself) when we call
        the update slot (not method).
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Explicit is better than implicit.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        I mentioned earlier, that it is not possible to mutate a variable from
        the outer scope without boilerplate. Well, as it turns out, there is a
        semi-reliable way to do so. It’s Python 3’s nonlocal keyword and it
        rocks!
      </p>

      <p>It allows us to write our modifier function like this.</p>

      <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre
            class="highlight"
          ><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">modifier</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">closure</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">nonlocal</span> <span class="n">x</span>
    <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">x</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">closure</span>
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        As it turns out, this works perfectly fine! You can make every non-local
        variable available as readwritable in the current scope, if it is in a
        parent scope. The only problem is that Python is a bit strange about
        what exactly counts as a nonlocal.
      </p>

      <p>Consider the following example (tested under v3.6.2).</p>

      <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre
            class="highlight"
          ><code><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">():</span>
  <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">10</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">g</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">nonlocal</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span>
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Now, does this code work? The answer is simple: perhaps. It all depends
        on its own level of indentation, because Python does not believe a
        global variable counts as a non-local.
      </p>

      <p>
        Global variables are not non-locals, hence they are non-non-local, which
        makes them …?
      </p>

      <p>
        By now you may have acquainted a taste for clean language design, but in
        case you haven’t, let me tell you: this is an instance of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have to admit, that bashing Python based on its implementation of
        lexical scoping maybe wasn’t fair. Lexical scoping might just not be
        pythonic, so let’s talk about dynamic scoping in Python for a brief
        second, because Python’s implementation of dynamic scoping is extremely
        intriguing.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is one of the lesser known features of the language, so I’ll give you
        a whirlwind introduction ot it.
      </p>

      <p>
        See, in Python, a function not only as access to the variables in
        lexical parent scopes, but also to all of the variables in its callers.
        And for what its worth, Python takes its duty to support that kind of
        scoping to new extremes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let’s take a look at my all-time favorite function for a moment: eval.
        “eval” is a function (for the pythonic definition of “function”), that
        takes a string and evaluates it as an expression. It then returns its
        result. What makes eval interesting though, is that the variables in
        that string expression (which it – the function defined somewhere deep
        down in the Python implementation of your choice – evaluates) are
        dispatched to their definition as visible for the caller of eval.
      </p>

      <p>
        That means, that Python functions can access their caller’s scope and
        even modify it.
      </p>

      <p>Let’s see what fun things we can do with this:</p>

      <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre
            class="highlight"
          ><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">g</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">'hello world'</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">insanity</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">'y'</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">eval</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">insanity</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>This code snippet indeed prints out “hello world.”</p>

      <p>
        Now I know, that many people think of eval as evil and that their
        opinion on dynamic scoping isn’t all that positive and open, but I
        personally don’t see a problem with supporting an obscure feature: there
        are use-cases for this.
      </p>

      <p>
        So let us try to make our own eval function out of pure fun. (Something
        you can also have with an inherently broken system)
      </p>

      <p>I start with the function signature:</p>

      <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre
            class="highlight"
          ><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">my_eval</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">string</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="o">...</span>
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Python’s support for call stack manipulation is so good, we only have to
        write a C-extension in order to get that call-stack and …
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m just kidding, Python ships with a powerful module called inspect,
        which allows you to get non-local variables on the call stack … as
        readonly. (Things being readonly except when they aren’t seems to be a
        common theme of Python)
      </p>

      <p>
        This means we will basically have to write a C-extension, which provides
        us with an incallereval, which we can use to complete the code-snippet
        shown above.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          There should be one – and preferably only one – obvious way to do it.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Speaking of obvious ways to do something, let’s take a look at the
        following code snippet in which we (try to) create a chain of functions,
        that print some values in a list. (Note, that the task is not about
        printing values, it is about creating functions)
      </p>

      <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre
            class="highlight"
          ><code><span class="n">values</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">))</span>

        <span class="n">nextstep</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="n">countdown</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        At least this piece of Python code will do exactly what you expect it to
        and print “5 5 5 5 5 0.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Yay? This is because for/in doesn’t make ‘value’ local to its body
        (watch my wording: I haven’t said “make a new child scope,” since that
        wouldn’t be possible for a whole list of other design oddities, like not
        being able to mutate variables from outer scopes without nonlocal
        boilerplate).
      </p>

      <p>
        This however isn’t an issue because there is an – I suppose elegant –
        solution to this problem:
      </p>

      <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">

      <p>And now we get the expected “5 4 3 2 1 0.”</p>

        Well, unless of course your printer is a local variable, in which case
        you have to use the nonlocal keyword to access it instead of the global
        keyword required to access globals. (Clean design hitting us again, I
        suspect)
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Simple is better than complex.</p>

        <p>Complex is better than complicated.</p>

        <p>Flat is better than nested.</p>

        <p>Readability counts.</p>

      <p>
        But hey, this isn’t that bad. At least you get access to the last
        element of the object you were iterating on using the loop variable
        after it finished. (I bet you use this feature all the time)
      </p>

      <p>
        Now for what it’s worth and in Python’s defence, the alternative would
        be to introduce a kind of semi-scope to the language, which holds local
        variables, though where assigning to any variable but a few truly-locals
        would set them to the outer scope, which isn’t the cleanest language
        design either. You see, Python messed that one up much much earlier.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next thing on the list: Object orientation. (Or how not to worry about
        it and happily override without any awareness whatsoever)
      </p>

      <p>Let’s make a simple Python class.</p>

      <p>
        As code prints 6 as you might expect. Now, imagine for a moment, that
        you weren’t the author of this class. (and I bet you use classes you
        aren’t the author of) You most likely don’t know all of the variables it
        provides and uses internally, and you most likely don’t know all of the
        methods it provides and uses internally.
      </p>

      <p>
        But maybe you are a risk seeker and still inherit from it and write the
        following.

        Well congratulations, you have successfully messed up the assumptions of
        A’s author, because your variable x collides with the A’s variable x and
        even your method causes A’s one to be overridden (in the worst case,
        without you noticing it).
      </p>

      <p>
        Note, that this does not apply to methods prefixed with two underscores.
      </p>

      <p>
        In oder to avoid that, you’d have to either be aware of all of the
        variables and methods of a parent class or you would have to use some
        weird naming conventions, like prefixing every variable and method with
        a class name.
      </p>

      <p>
        It seems to me, that the conveniences of dynamic scoping are deeply
        intermingled into all the other aspects of the Python language as well!
      </p>

      <p>
        But can we really blame the designers of Python for that? After all,
        coming up with a good object system is hard, <a href="https://coindataflow.com/en">some of them</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ignorant programmer might thing, that it would be possible to just
        provide a makeobject function, that creates a fresh minimal object, and
        setparents function, that alters the delegation tree, and just go on
        from there, so that the A class from above would look like the
        following.

        The problem with this is that classes aren’t just functions, so a class
        decorator would have to be made. Also, syntax for setting nested
        structures through “def” should exist for convenience, then. (This
        however is not pythonic, as it would add to the consistency between
        “def” and “=”).

        Being ignorant, she might also think, that defining B would then be as

        She might also think, that explicit overriding would then be possible
        through a providerof primitive, that would get the concrete object in
        the tree, which implements that certain functionality, so that a version
        of B, where x shall be overridden would look like this, assuming a
        parentofclass.

      <p>
        She might also assert, that this system includes metaclasses, since
        “class” could simply be replaced by any other metaclass, whose
        constructor would be used as a decorator and that adding a static method
        would be as free of magic as simply adding a method to the class object
        using def.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, she might think, that this system is free of all of the mentioned
        inconsistencies, like the function/callable differentiation.

      <p>She’d be right about all of that. It really can be that simple.</p>

        Even the implementation of class and makeclass would not be black magic.
