<h1>Filter</h1>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>This function has two issues: it is very slow and works not as expected (in a sence that it takes two seqs).</p>
<p>For a haskell-like filter function (which runs quite fast) use `hfilter'.</p>
<br/>
<code>hfilter[predicate-function; sequence-to-filter]</code>
<br/>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>filter/2: Filter out corresponding elements to 0</p>
<code>filter[filter-sequence; sequence-to-filter]</code>
<br/>
<h2>Example</h2>
<code>hfilter: {filter[y map x; x]}</code>
