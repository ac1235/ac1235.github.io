			<h2>What is AntLang?</h2>
			<p>AntLang is a programming language for sequence processing.</p>
			<p>Instead of using control structures or recursion, many algorithms are implemented
			as operations on sequences.</p>
			<p>This paradigm allows fast problem solving in mathematics and scripting.</p>
			<p>For example, some pages on this website are generated using <a href="https://github.com/ac1235/ac1235.github.io/blob/master/index.ant">an AntLang script</a>.</p>
